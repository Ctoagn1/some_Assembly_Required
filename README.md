# some_Assembly_Required
 A collaborative project between Ryan Kish (music), Wayne Zhen (assets) and Alex Jakimowicz (coding/design)(also me!!!)

 Making this over the course of a few days was very fun (and incredibly stressful) but for my very first game jam, I'm quite proud of it.
 Heavily inspired by TIS-100 and my love for low-level prpgramming, you must repair your computer by fixing all of its systems in assembly!

 The actual .exe/linux executable are available at `https://alxjay.itch.io/some-assembly-required`
 Also a shoutout to `https://github.com/henriquelalves/SimpleGodotCRTShader`, whose filter was incredibly helpful!
 Here's some screenshots:
